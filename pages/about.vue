        <p>
          I'm a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer with experience both in-house
          (at both technical and non-technical companies) and at a consultancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working in teams, no matter the size, whether that be in a
          leadership role or as a team member. I have built, mentored and
          managed teams from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is on writing clean, well-tested code that will delight the
          business and my fellow developers alike. I follow the DevOps
          philosophy and enjoy learning all things tech. Accompanying, you will
          find some of the projects I've worked on, across the stack.
          Deployment, governance/policy and architecture are difficult to
          showcase so please get in touch to discuss.
